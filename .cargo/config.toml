# Cargo configuration for kylix project

# Uncomment below to enable native CPU optimizations (AVX2, etc.)
# This significantly improves SIMD performance by avoiding runtime detection overhead.
# Note: Binaries built with this setting may not run on older CPUs.

# [build]
# rustflags = ["-C", "target-cpu=native"]

# For benchmarks, use native CPU features for maximum performance
[profile.bench]
# LTO for better optimization
